# RabbitManaged
A C# Port of the Rabbit stream cipher from the ECRYPT suite, RFC4503

All the example code for use is in the test program. 
Note: this isn't optimized code and is several years old, so it could benefit from the advancements of .Net 6 or being further optimized in C++/CLR.  While all tests pass from the RFC, this is also for informational purposes only, and shouldn't be used for production without a security audit, either for this source as it is or for the final version built into whatever project you have.
